The detail reads like a frame building wish-list: mechanically formed 6061 aluminium tubes, double butting, IS brake mount on the chainstay, internal cable routing, PressFit bottom bracket and a tapered head tube. Everything is there to ensure that not a single watt of power is wasted and that every steering input is transferred to the trail - and all this is achieved with incredibly low weight. We even took comfort into account and incorporated a 27.2mm seat post. The LTD SL can handle any trail and, thanks to Agile Ride Geometry, remains agile and lively whether your opt for the 27.5 or 29 inch option.

Components

Is this a performance trail bike... or a race bike? The extraordinary Fox Float 32 Performance suspension fork with 100mm travel and simple 3-way setting (Open, Medium, Firm) means you won't lose any time selecting the right suspension setup. To meet the needs of the most demanding rider we specced Shimano's new, crisp-shifting XT drivetrain and brake groupset with 26/36 chainset. The XT ShadowPlus rear mech with Direct Mount attachment delivers near-instantaneous shifts, while Shimano's I-Spec mount system cleans up the rider cockpit. High quality DT-Swiss technology provides the CSW MA 1.9/1.7 rims, laced to Shimano Deore hubs.",2016,products/None/cube_LTD.jpg,ltd-sl,860.0,0,2017-06-01 09:25:22.392325,2017-06-01 09:25:22.392325,3,1,2,1,2017-06-01 12:12:2410,LITENING C:62,"When every second counts - whether it's towards a podium finish or a personal best - you need a bike with uncompromising attention to detail. That's where our Litening C:62 Race comes in. The stunning performance of its stiff, light carbon frame matched with the unrivalled reliablity of Shimano's Dura Ace components means you'll extract the maximum possible performance from every pedal stroke, time after time.","Frame: These days everyone has a carbon frame in their range - but not all carbon frames are created equal. The C:62 chassis uses our Monocoque Advanced Twin Mould technology, which enables our engineers to use the minimum possible material where it matters most. The result is a frame that's incredibly stiff, light, strong and durable - but also surprisingly comfortable. It's the perfect match for our CUBE CSL C:62 Litening carbon fork, which quietens road vibrations while providing uncannily accurate steering. And the handling, as you'd expect from a performance bike, is exemplary: stable when you need it, lithe and agile when you're pushing your limits.",2017,products/None/download.png,litening-c62,1253.0,0,2017-06-01 09:27:05.027784,2017-06-01 09:27:05.027784,3,1,3,1,2017-06-01 12:12:2411,PHYSIO 10,False,"SPECIFICATIONS
